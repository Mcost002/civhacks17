# #CivHacks17

## Introduction

Deloitte, General Assembly, and Represently are proud to partner to present #CivHacks17, a data-driven hackathon to discuss an analyze civic outcomes. Participants from various skill levels will form teams of 2-3 to create data-driven solutions ton one of the prompts of their choice. The goal of a hackathon (hacking marathon) is to ship **something** to production as soon as possible: mockups, visualizations, a prototype, etc that you believe accomplishes the goal. The aggressive time constraint means even the most technically skilled teams will need to be cognizant of setting reasonable boundries for their implementation.

## Project Overview

## Schedule
 
- 8:30 AM: Check-In Opens
- 9:00 AM: Introductions
- 9:45 AM: Teams Form
- 10:00 AM: Hacking Begins
- 12:30 PM: Lunch
- 2:30 PM: Overview of Analytics @ Deloitte
- 5:30 PM: Hacking Concludes; Dinner
- 6:15 PM: Judging Begins
- 7:45 PM: Deliberation
- 8:00 PM: Winners Announced; Closing

## Deliverable
Every team will present a 6 minute pitch (you will be cut off!) on their findings to the judges panel at 6:15 PM. 

Presentations must include:

- A proven data analysis of contextualizing current study abroad figures. Given this context, provide recommendations for how the Embassy can increase their reach to encourage additional students
- Recommendations for improving French Embassy resources, particularly well-researched proposals surrounding a better user experience on frenchculture.org

## Teams
Teams are three to four people. Given the data analysis, user experience, and (potentially live) deployment component of your task, including a diversity of skillsets should be a priority. A team that has fully deployed interactive data visualization components may provide impressive analysis, but will lack recommendations for improving the experience to end users seeking additional study abroad information. Likewise, well-researched and prototyped solutions that lack data-inforced findings (particularly of the provided visa dataset) will lack quantitative validity.

## Resources


## Submissions
Submissions must be submitted via pull request to the submissions folder by 5:30 PM.

To submit, create a folder within the submission folder with your team name. In that folder, place your submission materials. All submissions must include the presentation materials your group is leveraging, whether this ranges from a PDF of a PPT to links (in a mardown file) to working prototypes and deployed visualization tools. (Bear in mind you cannot add files in excess of 100MB to your Github: you should save your presentation as a PDF)

If you need help with pull requests, find Joseph in advance of the 7:00 PM deadline. Please also view this [resource](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)

## Judging Criteria


The criteria is available [here](judging.md).


## Deloitte Info Sessions

There will be a Deloitte Info Session at 2:30. Attend if you would like further information about the analytics practice at Deloitte
